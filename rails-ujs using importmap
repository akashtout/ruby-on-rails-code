To add rails-ujs to Rails 7 :-

Pin it, to let the application know, which package to use. Enter in bash:
1)   ./bin/importmap pin @rails/ujs

And now you have in your config/importmap.rb file something like this:
pin "@rails/ujs", to: "https://ga.jspm.io/npm:@rails/ujs@7.0.1/lib/assets/compiled/rails-ujs.js"

2)   Now include @rails/ujs to your javascript. In file javascript/controllers/application.js add:

import Rails from '@rails/ujs';
Rails.start();

3) Restart your application server
